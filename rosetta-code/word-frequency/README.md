<h1>Word Frequency</h1>

<p>Given a text string and an integer n, return the n most common words in the file (and the number of their occurrences) in decreasing frequency.</p>

<p>Write a function to count the occurrences of each word and return the n most commons words along with the number of their occurrences in decreasing frequency.<p>
<ul>
  <li>The function should return a 2D array with each of the elements in the following form: [word, freq]. word should be the lowercase version of the word and freq the number denoting the count.</li>
  <li>The function should return an empty array, if no string is provided.</li>
  <li>The function should be case insensitive, for example, the strings "Hello" and "hello" should be treated the same.</li>
  <li>You can treat words that have special characters such as underscores, dashes, apostrophes, commas, etc., as distinct words.</li>
</ul>

<p>For example, given the string "Hello hello goodbye", your function should return [['hello', 2], ['goodbye', 1]].</p>
