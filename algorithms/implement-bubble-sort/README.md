<h1>Implement Bubble Sort</h1>

<p>The bubble sort method starts at the beginning of an unsorted array and 'bubbles up' unsorted values towards the end, iterating through the array until it is completely sorted. It does this by comparing</p>

<p>This method requires multiple iterations through the array and for average and worst cases has quadratic time complexity. While simple, it is usually impractical in most situations.</p>

<p>Instructions: Write a function bubbleSort which takes an array of integers as input and returns an array of these integers in sorted order from least to greatest.</p>
